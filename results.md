## Get the workflows working with biodiversity tasks

`{'faithfulness': 0.2222, 'llm_context_precision_without_reference': 0.5833}`

To get biodiversity-related workflows working on Galaxy, you can follow a structured approach based on best practices for using Galaxy workflows effectively:

1. **Use the Correct Galaxy Instance**: - Use the official Galaxy training tutorial instance (e.g., `ecology.usegalaxy.eu`) or your own Galaxy server where the workflow is available.
2. **Check Compatibility and Requirements**:- Ensure that all tools used in the workflow are installed on your Galaxy instance.- Verify that the input data format matches what the workflow expects (e.g., `.tabular` files).
3. **Input Data Preparation**: - Prepare biodiversity datasets properly, ensuring they are formatted correctly for each tool.
4. **Parameter Settings**:- Set parameters appropriately based on your dataset characteristics and analysis goals.- For example, adjust thresholds or select tools that handle abundance vs presence-absence data as needed.
5. **Troubleshooting Common Issues**: - If the workflow fails to run, check for missing inputs or incompatible tool versions.- Consult the original tutorial documentation (linked in the workflow metadata) for guidance on specific steps.
6. **Collaborate with Communities**:- Share workflows and data through platforms like WorkflowHub to ensure reproducibility across different Galaxy instances.By following these steps, you can effectively run biodiversity-related workflows even if they are not explicitly listed as standalone tools but are part of the training material or community tutorials.

## Get workflows that have text mining as a step

`{'faithfulness': 0.8000, 'llm_context_precision_without_reference': 1.0000}`

Based on the information you've shared, none of the described workflows explicitly mention text mining as a step.The first workflow (v1) is an RNA-seq analysis pipeline using WDL and CROMS for variant calling. The second workflow (DTC61 from Gitlab v2) appears to be a CWL-based workflow but doesn't specify any text mining steps in the provided metadata snippet.

## What workflows use LLMs or NLP steps?

`{'faithfulness': 0.4000, 'llm_context_precision_without_reference': 0.8333}`

"This workflow does not utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) or Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It is a bioinformatics pipeline focused on variant calling and structural variant benchmarking, utilizing standard computational tools rather than LLMs.To find workflows that do use these advanced AI techniques, you might want to look for other nf-core pipelines like `nf-core/vep` or `nf-core/mqc`, but they also don't explicitly mention using LLMs. However, there are some emerging bioinformatics workflows on WorkflowHub and elsewhere that may incorporate NLP or LLMs in the future.For example:- The [ncbi-bioprojects](https://github.com/nghosh/ncbi-bioproject) pipeline uses Python scripts to parse text-based data from NCBI databases, which could be considered a form of natural language processing- Some newer pipelines might incorporate LLMs for tasks like automated documentation generation or chatbot-style interfaces.But note: the specific workflow you're asking about (`nf-core/variantbenchmarking`) does not use LLMs or NLP techniques."

## I want to build an barplot figure, give me a workflow that produces this output

"Workflow: Compute daily and monthly mean from meteorological station measurementsThis workflow processes meteorological station measurements to compute daily and monthly means.### Workflow: Assembly with FlyeThis workflow assembles genomic data using Flye and generates outputs including Quast reports (tabular and HTML) and a bar chart showing contig sizes. Workflow: Plot-Nx-Size/mainThis workflow plots Nx Size data, producing figures like the #main/Size Plot which is likely a barplot."

## Get workflows that use tool MultiQc

`{'faithfulness': 0.3889, 'llm_context_precision_without_reference': 0.8333}`

"Based on the provided text, there are no specific details about other workflows that utilize the `MultiQC` tool beyond this pipeline (`nf-core/pangenome`). However, I can provide some general information:

1.  **The nf-core framework**: The pipeline is part of the `nf-core` framework (as mentioned in the metadata). Many other pipelines within the `nf-core` collection likely use MultiQc or similar tools for generating reports and aggregating quality control metrics.
2.  **General bioinformatics workflows**: MultiQC is a widely used tool, not specific to any one pipeline. It's commonly utilized by many community-curated bioinformatics pipelines (like those in nf-core) that process sequencing data because it provides a standardized way to collect and report summary statistics from various quality control tools.
3.  **The PGGB project**: The original `PGGB` tool mentioned might also use MultiQc or similar reporting mechanisms, although the text doesn't explicitly state this.To find specific workflows using MultiQC, you would need to search for other bioinformatics pipelines (like those on nf-corehub.org) that mention MultiQC in their output documentation or parameter files. However, based _only_ on the provided text about `nf-core/pangenome`, it cannot be definitively stated which other specific workflows use MultiQc.

**Answer:** The information provided does not explicitly list all workflows using MultiQC beyond this pipeline itself (`nf-core/pangenome`). It mentions that many pipelines within the `nf-core` framework utilize similar tools and might use MultiQC for reporting, but no specific other workflow is named in relation to it."

## What scholarly papers are using these cwl specific workflows?

`{'faithfulness': 0.1707, 'llm_context_precision_without_reference': 0.5000}`

"Based on the information provided, there is no direct list of scholarly papers implementing specific Common Workflow Language (CWL) workflows for variant calling and SNP effect analysis within this context.However, I can provide some general guidance based on my knowledge:

1.  **WorkflowHub** often indexes and promotes CWL implementations that are used in various bioinformatics applications, including genomics.
2.  The `sdPublisher` information points to WorkflowHub (Organization) as the source (`sdPublisher.@id: https://about.workflowhub.eu/`).

This suggests looking at papers or resources related to workflows hosted on WorkflowHub might be a good approach.To find specific scholarly papers implementing CWL workflows for variant calling and SNP effect analysis, you would typically need to search academic databases (like PubMed, Google Scholar) using keywords like Common Workflow Language AND variant calling or CWL workflow AND SNP.Here are some examples of tools that use CWL for genomics tasks:

- **Variant Calling:** `varfish` (formerly known as VarCall): This is a CWL implementation focused on somatic variant calling. It's likely referenced in papers related to cancer genomics or NGS-based mutation detection. Example paper area: Search for VarFish + CWL.
- **DeepVariant:** While developed by Google, DeepVariant has official CWL implementations and is widely used for variant calling. Papers describing its use might reference the CWL version. Example search terms: DeepVariant AND CWL, Google health AND variant calling workflow
- **GATK4 (Genome Analysis Toolkit):** The GATK team provides a CWL implementation of their tools, including variant calling. Papers using GATK often mention the CWL version if they are part of a larger project. Example search terms: GATK AND SNP, Broad institute AND CWL
- **SNP Effect Analysis / Annotation:** **VarFish:** This tool uses DeepVariant for calling variants and then analyzes them, including effect analysis. It's likely that papers implementing VarFish or its components would be relevant. Example paper area: Search for VarFish + effect, VarFish AND SNP **To find specific scholarly papers, you should perform a targeted search using academic databases (PubMed, Google Scholar) with keywords like:**
- **Common Workflow Language variant calling**
- **CWL variant calling pipeline**
- **CWL SNP analysis** **CWL GWAS association**
- **VarCall CWL** (or specific tool names)
- **DeepVariant CWL** (if looking for papers using the CWL version explicitly)

Since the provided data doesn't list any specific scholarly papers, I cannot give you a direct answer. You would need to conduct your own literature search focusing on these keywords and tools like VarCall/VarFish or DeepVariant in the context of variant calling and SNP analysis.WorkflowHub (mentioned via `sdPublisher`) is a platform that hosts workflows and their implementations might be referenced by papers, but without specific paper titles provided here, I cannot list them."
